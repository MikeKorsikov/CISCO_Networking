# The Cyber Kill Chain

Cyber Kill Chain - specifies what an attacker must complete to accomplish their goal.

Attacker = adversary = Threat actor 

Steps:
1 Reconnaissance
2 Weaponization
3 Delivery
4 Exploitation
5 Installation
6 Command and Control
7 Action on Objectives

###

Reconnaissance - perform research, gather intelligence, select target

Tactics (examples):
- harvest email addresses
- identify employees on social media
- discover internet facing servers
- conduct scans of networks (to identify IP addresses and ports)

###

Weaponization - use intel to develop a weapon against a target system

Tactics (examples):
- obtain automated tool to deliver the malware payload
- select or create a document to present to victim
- select or create a backdoor ond C&C infrastructure

###

Delivery - weapon is transmitted to the target

Tactics (examples):
- direct against web servers
- malicious email
- malware on USB
- compromised website

###

Exploitation - explot target (app, OS) vulnerability to gain control over target

Tactics (examples):
- use SW or HW vulnerability
- develop the "exploit"
- use victim triggered explot (e.g. opening email attachment)

###

Installation - establish a back door into system to allow conitnued access to target

Tactics (examples):
- installing webshell on web server for persistent access
- adding services,AutoRun keys
- modify timestamp of malware (to make it appear part of OS)

###

Command and control - establish CnC with target system

Tactics (examples):
- open two way communication channel to CnC infrastructure
- use DNS and email protocols (port 53 and 25)

###

Actions and objectives - actor achievig goal

Tactics (examples):
- collect credentials
- privilege escalation
- collect data
- destroy system- overwrite, modfy data
