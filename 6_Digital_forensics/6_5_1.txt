NIST Best practice:
1. Develop policy
2. Conduct BIA
3. Calculate risk
4. Identify preventive controls
5. Develop recovery strategies
6. Develop contingency plan
7. Test the plan
8. Maintain/update plan

###

Testing DRP:
- Tabletop exercise (hypothetical)
- Functional testing (aspect of plan tested)
- Operational exercise (involve service intrruption)
