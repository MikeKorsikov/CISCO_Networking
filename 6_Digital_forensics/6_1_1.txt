# Digital forensics

Process:
1) Collection (identify sources of data)
2) Examination (assess and extract info from data [decryption, decompression])
3) Analysis (draw conclusions)
4) Reporting (explanations offered)

Types:
a) direct - indisputably in the possession of the accused (or eyewitness evidence)
b) Indirect - circumstantial evidence

Types of evidence:
- Best (in the original state)
- Corroborating (supports an assertion that is developed from best evidence)
- Indirect (circumstantial evidence)

Collection order:
1) Volatile - memory registers, caches, RAM, temporary file systems
2) Non-volatile - remote logging, physical topologies, archived backup data

Details:
- who hass access to system
- at what level of permissions
- SW and HW configurations

###

Chain of customdy:
- who discovered and collected evidence
- times, places and personnel involved
- who has primary responsibility for evidence
- who has physical access to evidence

###

Original evidence - to be coppied
Copied evidence - to be analyzed

Do not (without instruction):
- shut down
- disconnect, unplug infected machines

###

Threat attribution - determening who is responsible for the attack

What helps to identify actor:
- IP address
- MAC address
- DHCP logs
- AAA logs
