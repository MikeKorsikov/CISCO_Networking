# Risk Assessment

Threat source types:
- Adversarial (individuals)
- Accidental (without intent)
- Structural (HW and SW failures)
- Environmental (external disasters)

Assess - probability vs impact/severity

Risk analysis goals:
- identify assets and their value
- identify vulnerabilities and threats
- quantify probability and impact
- balance impact and cost of mitigation

###

Qunatitative risk analysis:

1) Asset value (AV) - replacement cost
2) Exposure factor (EF) - subjective value lost due to threat
3) Single loss expectancy (SLE) = AV * EF 

4) Annualised rate of occurence (ARO) - probability of loss occurring during the year
5) Annual loss expectancy  = SLE * ARO

###

Qualitative risk analysis:
Risk matrix (impact vs likelyhood)

###

Risk mitigation:
Accept - (do nothing)
Reduce - (take steps)
Avoid - (workaround)
Transfer - (outsource, insurance)
