# Network and server profiling

Tools to characterize traffic characteristics:
- NetFlow
- Wireshark

Network profile elements:
- session duration
- total throughput
- ports used
- critical asset address space

Server profiling - to establish the accepted operating state of server.
Server profile - server baseline, establishes parameters that are accepted

Server profile elements:
- listening ports (allowed to be open)
- logged in users and accounts 
- service accounts (definitions of the type of service that app is allowed to run)
- software environment (tasks, processes, apps that are permitted to run)

###

Network anomaly detection:
- recognises network traffic caused by worm activity
- identifies infected hosts

Types:
- statistical approach 
- behavioral approach
- rule-based approach (patterns based)


###

Network vulnerability testing
- risk analysis (assess impact on assets) > conducted by individuals
- vulnerabilities assessment (patch management, port scanning) > Nessus, Nmap
- penetration testing (hacking techniques) > Metasploit, ethical hackers
