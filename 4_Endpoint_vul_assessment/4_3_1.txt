Patch management - verifying that the patch is installed on all required systems
Tools:  SolarWinds, LANDesk, SCCM

Techniques:
- agend-based (requires a software agent to be running on each host to be patched)
- agentless Scanning (Patch management servers scan the network for devices that require patching)
- passive network monitoring (Devices requiring patching are identified through the monitoring of traffic on the network)

Vendor > chaching device > security team > patch management server > endpoint
